# Lane_detection_OpenCV

This project is a real-time lane detection system that uses computer vision techniques and Streamlit to create an interactive web application. It processes input images to identify and highlight road lanes by leveraging OpenCV for edge detection, region of interest extraction, and Hough transform for line identification. The result is a user-friendly app that allows users to upload their images and see the detected lanes.
